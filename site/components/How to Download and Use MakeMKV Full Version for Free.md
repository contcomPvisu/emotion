However, MakeMKV is not a free software. It has a 30-day trial period, after which you need to purchase a registration key to continue using it. The official website of MakeMKV offers the download links for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux versions, but they are not signed by Apple or Microsoft, so you might need to adjust some settings to install them. Also, the official website does not provide any direct download links for the full version of MakeMKV, only the beta version.
 
So how can you download and use MakeMKV full version for free? One way is to look for some unofficial sources that offer MakeMKV.full.rar files. These are compressed files that contain the full version of MakeMKV, usually with a crack or a patch that can bypass the registration process. However, these sources are not reliable or safe. They might contain viruses, malware, spyware or other harmful programs that can damage your computer or steal your personal information. They might also be outdated or incompatible with your system.
